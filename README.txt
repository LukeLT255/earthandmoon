Hi!

This is a three.js app the renders 3d versions of the moon and earth, as well as a background map of star point. A 3d rendering of the earth and moon using three.js, by layering a few different types of maps (daytime, nighttime, clouds, and a fresnel map for the atmospheric glow.)
All the lighting and modeling was done with three.js. Three.js is a very cool js library that can be used to work with
3d objects in the browser, allowing for some really cool design options.
